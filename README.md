TODO:
- [ ] Improve the typst tool by parsing from a PDF instead of a svg to get actual text nodes instead of the paths provided by the svg generated by typst.
- [ ] Document all of the crates.

- [ ] Better cursor icon management (handle from enter/leave events)

- [ ] Render to textures and blend when needed, this can reduce the amount of times needed to render the vertices (which is more expensive)
of both the user interface and the canvas.
This can also allow us to apply anti-aliasing to the texture e.g. the user interface, which will make svg primitives look better.

- [ ] Fix fractional scaling, we should render at the new lower resolution when the display is using fractional scaling
instead of using wp-viewporter which relies on the compositor to downscale (which can cause artefacts when rendering e.g. text).

- [ ] Add gap between texture allocations in atlas to avoid bleeding.
- [ ] Make graphics library renderer agnostic and move rendering details into its own backend.

- [ ] Subpixel rendering opt-in for gui
- [ ] Implement a simple editor using the [`modit`] crate.

- [ ] Use dmabuf to pass the buffer directly to the compositor. Should be easier with wgpu v26.x.x due to supporting enabling vulkan extensions.
Would look into using drm-rs and gbm to create the buffer

Non urgent:
- [ ] Add color to typst code blocks using treesitter.
- [ ] Make graphics crate hold primitives for drawing without implementations,
      the implementations will then go into the `renderer` allowing for consumers to implement
      their own rendering backend, and allow us to provide multiple rendering backends (wgpu, tinyskia, etc).
